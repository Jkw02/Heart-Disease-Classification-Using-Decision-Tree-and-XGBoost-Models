# Heart Disease Prediction Using Decision Tree and XGBoost

This notebook explores the use of Decision Tree and XGBoost models to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient characteristics. It focuses on model optimisation and evaluation using real clinical data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains clinical and physiological information from 303 patients, each with 13 features and one binary outcome indicating whether heart disease is present (1) or not (0).

## Variables include:

Age, sex, and chest pain type

Resting blood pressure and cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar, ECG results, and maximum heart rate

Exercise-induced angina and ST depression (oldpeak)

Slope of ST segment, number of major vessels, and thalassemia type
